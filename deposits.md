# Deposits

After fully registering with us you get a BSB and a dedicated bank account number. Every deposit to this account would increase your FlashFX balance.

You can receive notifications via [Webhooks](webhooks/webhooks.md) about every deposit.

The deposit data includes the payment reference \(we call it `externalReference` in this API\).

By default, only yourself is allowed to deposit. However, we can enable third party deposits feature for your account. This, effectively, makes your account number a local collection account.

To browse your deposits you can use our FlashConnect tool: [https://connect.flash-fx.com/](https://connect.flash-fx.com/)

\(Coming Soon\) You can query your deposits via this API.
