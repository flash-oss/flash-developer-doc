# Change log

## 2021-08-13

### Changed \(BREAKING\)

* Removed **XRP** currency form the list of supported currencies.

## 2021-07-22

### Changed \(BREAKING\)

* While creating sub-clients the address of the person/company was not required. It was a bug which was fixed. To create a sub-client you would also need their: **street** address, **suburb**/city, **state**/region, **postcode**, and country.

## 2021-07-14

### Changes

* Allow `accountNo` to be 4 digits long. Some old Japanese bank accounts could be just 4 digits.

## 2021-07-08

### Added

* The ability to query deposits, withdrawals, payments by the associated sub-client \(`subClientId`\).
* The payments can also have sub-clients now. Added the `Payment.subClient` field.

## 2021-06-29

### Added

*  The `totalFee` property to both `Deposit` and `Withdrawal` types as well as webhook payloads.

## 2021-06-22

### Added

*  The `bankInfo` reference query. You can now validate your BSB for existence, check if we support your BIC, and retrieve BIC \(aka SWIFT code\) by IBAN.

## 2021-06-17

### Added

*  The `fundingAccounts` and `SubClient.fundingAccounts` queries. It returns international bank account numbers you can deposit in order to bring money to Australia. See [Auto receive funds](payments/auto-receive-funds.md) for more details.

## 2021-05-25

### Changed

*  The `senderId` was always required when creating withdrawals via `createWithdrawal`. But now, if you provided the `subClientId` and didn't provide the `senderId` the sub-client becomes the sender, and will be reported to the government as the sender. However, you still must provide the `senderId` if your sub-client moves funds for other people/companies.

## 2021-05-17

### Changed \(BREAKING\)

* Replaced `docIssuer`, `docType` and `docNumber` fields from `CreateSubClientInput` with `idDoc` nested field instead. 

## 2021-04-26

### Changed

* `RecipientAccountIdType` was fully duplicating the `AccountIdType`. Replace the former with the latter. This might break your auto-generated code in strongly typed languages. But won't change any API queries or responses. So, this change is not considered to be a breaking.

## 2021-04-16

### Added

* Added ability to disable and activate sub-clients
  * mutation `disableSubClient(id: ID!): MutateSubClientReply`
  * mutation `activateSubClient(id: ID!): MutateSubClientReply`

## 2021-04-12

### Added

* Added deposit queries
  * query `deposits(input: DepositQueryInput): [Deposit]`
  * query `deposit(id: ID!): Deposit`
* **Introduced sub-client feature** â€“ transactional virtual account numbers for AUD processing in Australia.
  * query `subClients(input: SubClientQueryInput): [SubClient]`
  * query `subClient(id: ID!): SubClient`
  * mutation  `createSubClient(input: CreateSubClientInput!): MutateSubClientReply`
* Deposit and withdrawal webhooks now include `subClient` object with sub-client information when present

## 2020-02-11

### Added

* New items in `RecipientQueryInput`. This means that recipients can be searched by:
  * `firstName`
  * `lastName`
  * `middleName`
  * `dob` - date of birth
  * `companyName`
  * `phCashoutNetwork`
  * `payid`
  * `bic`
  * `iban`

  * query `withdrawals(input: WithdrawalQueryInput): [Withdrawal]`
  * mutation `createWithdrawal(input: CreateWithdrawalInput!): CreateWithdrawalReply`

* You can now query your recipients by `accountIdType` property. For example: `recipients(input: {` **`accountIdType: PH_CASH`** `})`

### Removed \(BREAKING\)

* Removed the unused enum `PaymentType`. It has no sense and was deprecated a year ago.
  * Simultaneously removed properties `Payment.paymentType`, `PaymentQueryInput.paymentTypes`, `PaymentInput.paymentType`.
* Removed the long deprecated `PaymentInput.recipient` object. The only way to provide a recipient for a payment is via `PaymentInput.recipientId`. You would need to [pre-create the recipient](recipients/#create-a-recipient) beforehand.
* Removed the never used `AccountIdType` enum values: `BPAY`, `FIN_BTN`, `INTERAC`.
