# FX Payments

You can [retrieve](query-payments.md) all or some of your payments. If you are an organisation with multiple users then you have access to all their payments.

You can [create payments](send-funds.md). But before you need to:

* Have a recipient ID (see [Recipients](../../moving-funds/recipients/) to query your address book); otherwise
* Understand the supported delivery methods using the [availableDeliveryMethods](../../moving-funds/recipients/delivery-methods.md) query and [create a new recipient](../../moving-funds/recipients/#create-a-recipient)

Once you have the recipient ID, you can initiate a withdrawal.
