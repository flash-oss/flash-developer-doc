# Webhooks

There are two types of webhooks in FlashFX.

* [Regular webhooks](webhooks.md) - a URL should be saved to your [FlashConnect](https://connect.flash-fx.com/) settings. All types of events.
* [Ad hoc webhooks](adhoc-webhooks.md) - you should provide a URL per payment/transaction being created. Only "payment" and "withdrawal" events are supported.
