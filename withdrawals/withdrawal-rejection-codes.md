# Withdrawal rejection codes

If your withdrawal is canceled by our Compliance team, the unique `rejectCode` and a corresponding standard `statusMessage` will be assigned to this transaction and sent to your application via [withdrawal\_canceled](https://developer.flash-payments.com/webhooks#withdrawal\_cancelled) webhook to be used for a subsequent integration action such as field mapping or reconciliation.&#x20;

Below is the latest list of our supported rejection codes and standard status messages. Please note, while the **rejection codes are unique**, you might see the corresponding free text status messages modified by the Compliance team for more clarity and accuracy.&#x20;
