# Withdrawal rejection codes

After withdrawal is canceled by the Compliance team, the unique `rejectCode` and a corresponding standard `statusMessage` are assigned to this transaction and sent to your application via [`withdrawal_canceled`](https://developer.flash-payments.com/webhooks#withdrawal\_cancelled) webhook to be used for a subsequent action with your integration such as field mapping or reconciliation.&#x20;

Below is the latest list of our supported rejection codes and standard status messages. Please note, while the **rejection codes are unique**, you might see the corresponding status messages modified by the Compliance team for more clarity and accuracy.&#x20;
