# Withdrawals

You can [retrieve](query-withdrawals.md) all or some of your withdrawals.

You can [create withdrawals](withdraw-funds.md). By default you can withdraw only to your personal Virtual Account Number (VAN).

If you are a fully verified customer you can payout to any bank account number in Australia. You'd need to:

* have a recipient ID (see [Recipients](../recipients/) to query your address book); otherwise
* understand the supported delivery methods using the [availableDeliveryMethods](../recipients/required-fields.md) query and [create a new recipient](../recipients/#create-a-recipient)

Having a recipient ID you can now withdraw money.
