# Withdraw funds

To make a withdrawal, you need to execute the `createWithdrawal` mutation as below.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You must have enough [balance](../balance/) in your account for the chosen `currency` to make a withdrawal.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Query" %}
```graphql
mutation {
  createWithdrawal(
    input: {
      amount: 1000
      currency: AUD
      externalReference: "invoice #123"
      recipientId: "5ba89a6b35a2b327b81ffc3b"
      senderId: "5eaf71a1cb328c56f94f9375"
      externalId: "12344321"
      idempotencyKey: "12344321"
    }
  ) {
    success
    code
    message
    withdrawal {
      id
      status
      amount
      currency
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "createWithdrawal": {
      "success": true,
      "code": "OK",
      "message": "Scheduled for immediate execution",
      "withdrawal": {
        "id": "60711af8c078ba061f623531",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "amount": 1000,
        "currency": AUD
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Payment reference - `externalReference`

Arbitrary text, which will be seen in the ultimate recipient's bank statement. E.g. `"invoice #123"`. Will be eventually truncated to `18` ASCII chars if delivered via Australia's old (DE, Direct Entry) payment system. However, if you choose to use the real-time NPP network, then the maximum length is `280` chars.

### Recipient - `recipientId`

You should [pre-create recipients](../recipients/#create-a-recipient) and provide us with their ID. The recipient's Australian account must be either `BSB` or `PAYID` (coming soon).

### Sender - `senderId` or `subClientId` , or neither

In the above `createWithdrawal` example, you had to first [pre-create a sender](../senders.md#create-a-sender) and use `senderId` as an input. Alternatively, if your account is configured to disburse funds **on behalf of** your [sub-clients](https://developer.flash-payments.com/sub-clients), you may provide us with the sub-client ID, and the withdrawal created will be linked to that sub-client. In this case, the `subClientId` will be used as the sender and will be reported to the government.

To use `subClientId` as the sender for your withdrawal, please execute the `createWithdrawal` mutation as below.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Query" %}
```graphql
mutation {
  createWithdrawal(
    input: {
      amount: 1000
      currency: AUD
      externalReference: "invoice #1234"
      recipientId: "5ba89a6b35a2b327b81ffc3b"
      subClientId: "3fbj71b1dc328d56g94g9375"
      externalId: "12344321"
      idempotencyKey: "12344321"
    }
  ) {
    success
    code
    message
    withdrawal {
      id
      status
      amount
      currency
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
```
 {
  "data": {
    "createWithdrawal": {
      "success": true,
      "code": "OK",
      "message": "Scheduled for immediate execution",
      "withdrawal": {
        "id": "60711af8c078ba061f623531",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "amount": 1000,
        "currency: AUD
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
We are legally obliged to collect the actual sender and beneficiary details. Please do not send us intermediate organisation details such as exchanges, banks, gateways, etc.&#x20;

If it is an intermediate, please see [Instiutions](withdraw-funds.md#institutions) instead.&#x20;

Please always send us the final funds, sender and recipient. If sending to yourself,  please provide your own details. See the schema in [Playground](https://api.uat.flash-payments.com.au/) for other recipient details options.

If sending from yourself, there's an option to use your company's Flash account details as sender by default. Please consider the example below.
{% endhint %}

If your company is the ultimate sender for a withdrawal, you can skip both the `senderId` and `subClientId`. In this situation, we will use your companyâ€™s Flash account as the sender for the transaction. Please note that a new sender record will not be created in this case.

Please execute the following `createWithdrawal` mutation to use  your company's Flash account details as sender.

{% tab title="Query" %}

mutation {
  createWithdrawal(
    input: {
      amount: 500
      currency: AUD
      externalReference: "invoice #123"
      recipientId: "661e293b14a0e678c37fa327"

### Instructing Institutions&#x20;

An organisation that instructed you to make a withdrawal. This data is mandatory if you submit this withdrawal on behalf of another financial institution.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information please see [Institutions](../institutions.md).
{% endhint %}

#### Using existing institutions `instructingInstitutionId`

This optional field refers to an existing `Institution` that was created earlier in the Flash Connect interface or via this API.

#### Create institutions on the fly using the `instructingInstitution` field

Optional field that allows you to provide [Institution](../institutions.md) details without pre-creating one. Once passed, Flash Payments will create the Institution for you. Before creating an institution, we will try to find an existing one:&#x20;

* By `instructingInstitution.externalId` if present.
* By `instructingInstitution.businessNumber` AND `instructingInstitution.address.country`

### Callback (aka [Webhook](../webhooks/adhoc-webhooks.md)) URI

We recommend against continuous polling for withdrawal status changes. Instead, please use `callbackUri`.

The optional `callbackUri` will be invoked several times during the processing of a withdrawal. These callbacks will usually occur soon (within several seconds) after the initial create withdrawal call - but may be delayed in some cases. The example JSON payloads can be found on the [Webhooks page](../webhooks/#example-payloads).

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### Security note

The callback (aka [webhook](../webhooks/adhoc-webhooks.md)) endpoint URI can be invoked by anyone on the internet. Thus opening up a potential attack vector. See [Webhooks](../webhooks/adhoc-webhooks.md) page to secure your data properly.
