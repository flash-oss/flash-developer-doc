# Payments

You can [retrieve](query-payments.md) all or some of your payments. If you are an organisation with multiple users then you have access to all their payments.

You can [create payments](send-funds.md). But before you need to:

* have a recipient ID \(see [Recipients](../recipients/) to query your address book\); otherwise
* understand the supported delivery methods using the [availableDeliveryMethods](../recipients/required-fields.md) query and [create a new recipient](../recipients/#create-a-recipient)

Having a recipient ID you can now send money.
