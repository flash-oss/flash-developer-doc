# Send funds

To make a payment from AUD to another currency you need to execute the `createPayment` mutation as below.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that you must have enough AUD balance to make an outbound AUD payment.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Query" %}
```graphql
mutation {
  createPayment(
    input: {
      fromCurrency: AUD
      toCurrency: USD
      size: 1000
      currency: AUD
      reason: BUSINESS
      sourceOfFunds: BUSINESS_FUNDS
      externalReference: "my ref 221b"
      senderId: "6092360ae40e2cfb52f85be1"
      recipientId: "5ba89a6b35a2b327b81ffc3b"
      externalId: "12344321"
      idempotencyKey: "12344321"
    }
  ) {
    success
    code
    message
    payment {
      id
      status
      size
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "createPayment": {
      "success": true,
      "code": "SUCCESS",
      "message": "Scheduled for immediate execution",
      "payment": {
        "id": "60711af8c078ba061f623531",
        "status": "OPEN",
        "size": 1000
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Recipient - `recipientId`

You should [pre-create recipients](../recipients/#create-a-recipient) and send us their ID.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We are legally obliged to collect the actual sender and beneficiary details. Please do not send us intermediate organisation details such as exchanges, banks, gateways, etc.

If it is an intermediate, please see [Instiutions](send-funds.md#institutions) instead.

Please always send us the ultimate sender and recipient. If sending to yourself,  please provide your own details. See the schema in [Playground](https://api.uat.flash-payments.com.au/) for other recipient details options.

If sending from yourself, there's an option to use your company's Flash account details as sender by default. Please consider the examples below.
{% endhint %}

### Sender - `senderId` or `subClientId`  or neither <a href="#sender-senderid-or-subclientid" id="sender-senderid-or-subclientid"></a>

In the above `createPayment` example, you had to [pre-create a sender](https://developer.flash-payments.com/senders#create-a-sender) and use `senderId` as an input. Alternatively, if your account is configured to make FX payments **on behalf of** your [sub-clients](https://developer.flash-payments.com/sub-clients), you may provide us with the sub-client ID, and the FX payment created will be linked to that sub-client. In this case, the `subClientId` will be used as the sender and will be reported to the government.

To use `subClientId` as the sender for your payments, please execute the `createPayment` mutation as below.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Query" %}
```graphql
mutation {
  createPayment(
    input: {
      fromCurrency: AUD
      toCurrency: USD
      size: 1000
      currency: AUD
      reason: BUSINESS
      sourceOfFunds: BUSINESS_FUNDS
      externalReference: "my ref 221c"
      subClientId: "6092360bf40f2dgc52f85cf1"
      recipientId: "5ba89a6b35a2b327b81ffc3b"
      externalId: "12344321"
      idempotencyKey: "12344321"
    }
  ) {
    success
    code
    message
    payment {
      id
      status
      size
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "createPayment": {
      "success": true,
      "code": "SUCCESS",
      "message": "Scheduled for immediate execution",
      "payment": {
        "id": "60711bg8d078cb061g623531",
        "status": "OPEN",
        "size": 1000
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

If your company is the ultimate sender for an FX payment, you can skip both the `senderId` and `subClientId`. In this situation, we will use your companyâ€™s Flash account as the sender for the payment. Please note that a new sender record will not be created in this case.

Please execute the following `createPayment` mutation to use your company's Flash account details as sender.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Query" %}
```graphql
mutation {
  createPayment(
    input: {
      fromCurrency: AUD
      toCurrency: EUR
      size: 1000
      currency: AUD
      reason: BUSINESS
      sourceOfFunds: BUSINESS_FUNDS
      externalReference: "my ref 234"
      recipientId: "67d7d75ab8db0fdfccfb16b2"
      externalId: "0123443210"
      idempotencyKey: "0000012344321000"
    }
  ) {
    success
    code
    message
    payment {
      id
      status
      size
      sender {
         firstName
         lastName
         companyName
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "createPayment": {
      "success": true,
      "code": "SUCCESS",
      "message": "Scheduled for immediate execution",
      "payment": {
        "id": "67d8e98caaa23286e1a1fd00",
        "status": "OPEN",
        "size": 1000,
        "sender": {
          "firstName": "John",
          "lastName": "Smith",
          "companyName": "Smith Consulting Pty Ltd"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Callback (aka [Webhook](../webhooks/adhoc-webhooks.md)) URI

We recommend against continuous polling for payment status changes. Instead, please use `callbackUri`.

The optional `callbackUri` will be invoked several times during the processing of a payment. These callbacks will usually occur soon (within several seconds) after the initial create payment call - but may be delayed in some cases. The example JSON payloads can be found on the [Webhooks page](../webhooks/#example-payloads).

Please note that `toAmount` (or `fromAmount`) and other fluctuating payment properties can change during payment execution.

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### Security note

The callback (aka [webhook](../webhooks/adhoc-webhooks.md)) endpoint URI can be invoked by anyone in the internet. Thus opening up a potential attack vector. See [Webhooks](../webhooks/adhoc-webhooks.md) page to secure your data properly.
